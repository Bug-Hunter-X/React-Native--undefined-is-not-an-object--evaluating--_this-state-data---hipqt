The solution is to ensure that the component only tries to access the state variable or prop after it has been assigned a value. There are several ways to achieve this:

1. Conditional Rendering:
   Only render the component that uses the state or prop after the data is loaded. 

2. Using the Optional Chaining Operator (?.)
   If you are sure that the component state is optional, then using optional chaining operator will prevent error:

```javascript
//In the render method:
<Text>{this.state.data?.name}</Text>
```

3. Setting a default value in the state:
   Initialize the state with a default value so there's always something to access.

```javascript
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = {
    data: null, // Default value
  };
}
```

Choose the solution that best fits your application's needs. The optional chaining approach is generally preferred for its conciseness and safety, while conditional rendering offers more control over what's displayed during loading.  Using a default value is helpful when you want to display something while awaiting data.
