# React Native Undefined is not an object Error

This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: "undefined is not an object (evaluating '_this.state.data')".  This occurs when trying to access a state variable or prop before it's been assigned a value.  The example shows how this error occurs and how to prevent it using asynchronous operations and conditional rendering.
